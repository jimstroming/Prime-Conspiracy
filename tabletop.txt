You're on a DIY kick and want to build a circular dining table which can be 
split in half so leaves can be added when entertaining guests. As luck would 
have it, on your last trip to the lumber yard, you came across the most pristine 
piece of exotic wood that would be perfect for the circular table top. 
Trouble is, the piece is rectangular. You are happy to have the leaves fashioned 
from one of the slightly-less-than-perfect pieces underneath it, but thereâ€™s still 
the issue of the main circle. You devise a plan: cut two congruent semicircles 
from the perfect 4-by-8-foot piece and reassemble them to form the circular top 
of your table. What is the radius of the largest possible circular table you 
can make?

 Let's solve this geometrically.
 
 We know that the semicircle has to fit in 1/2 of the rectangle.
 We do not know how the rectangle is split in half.
 We do know the split has to go through the center of the rectangle,
 so we can have a symmetric solution.
 
 Let's start with the semicircle, and try to fit it inside a right 
 triangle with length twice the width.  
 
 What we end up with is the straight side of the semicircle on the 
 hypotenuse, and the circle is tangent to the two sides of the 
 triangle. 
 
 From the definition of a tangent line, the two lines from the 
 center of the hemisphere to the tangent points must be perpendicular
 to the side, forming a right angle.
 
 If x, y is the coordinate of the center of the circle.
 
 x = r
 y+r = 4
 but y = 0.5 x, because the rectangle is twice and long as wide.
 
 so 
 r = 2y
 y + 2y = 4
 y = 4/3
 r = 2y = 8/3 = 2 2/3 
 
 Hence, the radius is 2 2/3.

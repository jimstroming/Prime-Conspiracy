 Let's solve this geometrically.
 
 We know that the semicircle has to fit in 1/2 of the rectangle.
 We do not know how the rectangle is split in half.
 We do know the split has to go through the center of the rectangle,
 so we can have a symmetric solution.
 
 Let's start with the semicircle, and try to fit it inside a right 
 triangle with length twice the width.  
 
 What we end up with is the straight side of the semicircle on the 
 hypotenuse, and the circle is tangent to the two sides of the 
 triangle. 
 
 From the definition of a tangent line, the two lines from the 
 center of the hemisphere to the tangent points must be perpendicular
 to the side, forming a right angle.
 
 If x, y is the coordinate of the center of the circle.
 
 x = r
 y+r = 4
 but y = 0.5 x, because the rectangle is twice and long as wide.
 
 so 
 r = 2y
 y + 2y = 4
 y = 4/3
 r = 2y = 8/3 = 2 2/3 
 
 Hence, the radius is 2 2/3.

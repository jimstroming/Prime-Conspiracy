You have a camel and 3,000 bananas. (Because of course you do.) You would like to sell 
your bananas at the bazaar 1,000 miles away. Your loyal camel can carry at most 1,000 
bananas at a time. However, it has an insatiable appetite and quite the nose for bananas
 â€” if you have bananas with you, it will demand one banana per mile traveled. In the 
 absence of bananas on his back, it will happily walk as far as needed to get more 
 bananas, loyal beast that it is. What should you do to get the largest number of 
 bananas to the bazaar? What is that number?

 Let's solve this logically.  
 
 You can't just load up 1000 bananas on a camel and drive him straight to the bazaar;
 he will be out of bananas when he get tot he bazaar.
 
 So a simple improvement is to have the camel take the bananas to the half way point.
 In 3 trips, you can have 1500 bananas at the 500 mile point.  Then, in two trips,
 the camel can bring 750 camels to the bazaar.
 
 But that does not seem optimal.  To find an optimal solution, you need to 
 minimize the number of miles the camel travels carrying a banana, since
 
 bananas left = 3000 - miles traveled carrying a banana.
 
 In order to minimize the number of miles traveled carrying a banana,
 you want to keep that camel as fully loaded as possible, so he takes
 the fewest number of trips.  You want the portion where he has to take
 three trips to be as short as possible.  Then, you want the portion where
 he takes two trips to be as short as possible.
 
 So start with 1000 bananas.  Have him travel 334 miles, so he has 666 bananas
 left, and drop them off at mile 334.  Do the same 3 times and there will be
 1998 bananas at mile 334.
 
 Now, have him load half of those banas, 999, and travel another 499 miles
 to mile 833, where there will be 500 bananas left.  Have him do that twice
 and you have 1000 bananas at mile 833.
 
 Now, have him load all 1000 bananas and travel 167 miles to the bazaar,
 where we will have 833 bananas.
